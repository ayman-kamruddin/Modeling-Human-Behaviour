## Overview

This project explores human navigation and decision-making within a **first-person herding task**. Participants are tasked with corralling autonomous target agents into a predefined containment zone, navigating dynamically shifting environments. This work emphasizes **dynamical perceptual-motor primitives (DPMPs)** to model and simulate human behavioral dynamics and decision-making in real-time.

### Key Features of the study:
- **Single Player, First-Person Perspective:** Designed to emulate realistic navigation challenges.
- **Dynamical Modeling:** Implements low-dimensional dynamical systems to predict movement trajectories and decision strategies.
- **Heuristic Integration:** Captures target selection decisions using simple and intuitive policies.
- **Artificial Agent Modeling:** Provides insights into developing robust human-machine teaming applications.
